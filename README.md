## What is Racket?
[Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) is a general purpose, multi-paradigm programming language in the Lisp-Scheme family. One of its design goals is to
serve as a platform for language creation, design, and implementation. The language is used in a variety of contexts such as
scripting, general-purpose programming, computer science education, and research.

## How to Run?
1. To run the solution you will need to ensure that you have [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) installed locally.          
2. Once [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) is installed you can **clone**/**download** this repository      
3. cd Theory-of-Algorithms-CA      
```
Run your racket file:
racket 'your .rkt file' (e.g. racket 1.decide-prime/1.decide-prime.rkt).
or
Run the scripts (.vscode/tasks.json):
run command(Mac): cmd + shift + B.
```
