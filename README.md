## What is Racket?
[Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) is a general purpose, multi-paradigm programming language in the Lisp-Scheme family. One of its design goals is to
serve as a platform for language creation, design, and implementation. The language is used in a variety of contexts such as
scripting, general-purpose programming, computer science education, and research.
